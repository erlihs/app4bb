To host a website, you'll need several key components and steps.

**Web Hosting**: You need a web server to store your website's files and make them accessible to visitors.

**Email Hosting**: to get custom email addresses associated with your domain (e.g., yourname@yourwebsite.com), needed for obtaining SSL Certificate.

**DNS Configuration**: Set up DNS records to point your domain to the hosting server. This typically involves configuring name servers or A/CNAME records with your domain registrar.

**SSL Certificate**: It's crucial to secure your website with an SSL certificate.

**Continuous integration and continuous delivery**: to automate and streamline the building, testing, and deployment of the application.
