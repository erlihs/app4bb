# Brand Identity and Visual Style

Traditionally, creating a brand identity and visual style required outsourcing to professionals. While many aspects of software engineering can be self-taught, design often seemed to demand an inherent artistic talent. Without that natural gift, businesses would invest significantly in professional design services to achieve the desired aesthetic appeal.

However, with the advent of AI tools, this process has become more accessible and achievable for individuals and teams, even without formal design expertise. Here's how you can establish a professional brand identity and visual style on your own:

### 1. Choosing a Name for Your Project

While AI can assist with generating name ideas, naming your project is often a step where a personal touch adds significant value. Your project name is foundational to its identity, so consider the following elements:

- **Short Name**: A succinct identifier, e.g., _Bullshit Bingo_
- **Long Name**: A more descriptive version, e.g., _Bullshit Bingo: Collection of Sources and Guides_
- **Abbreviation**: A memorable acronym, e.g., _BB_
- **Slogan**: A concise tagline, e.g., _Release the energy to focus on business_

If you're struggling to finalize a name, tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can provide inspiration. Always perform an online search to ensure your chosen name is unique and doesn’t conflict with existing trademarks.

### 2. Developing a Color Scheme

A strong color scheme is essential for creating a cohesive visual identity. While AI can suggest palettes, grounding your choices in personal significance can enhance emotional resonance. Follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Personal Image**: Select a photo from your collection that resonates with you or your project’s theme.

2. **Avoid Copyright Issues**: Refrain from using images sourced online unless you have explicit rights.

3. **Extract Colors**: Use tools or AI platforms to analyze your photo and derive a palette. Applications like [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) or online services such as [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature) can assist.

4. **Generate a Theme File**: With the help of ChatGPT or other AI, create a color scheme object suitable for use in design projects. Example:

![Hengill Volcano in Iceland](./hengill-volcano-iceland.jpg)

```json
{
  "background": "#FFFFFF",
  "surface": "#FFFFFF",
  "surface-bright": "#FFFFFF",
  "surface-light": "#EEEEEE",
  "surface-variant": "#424242",
  "on-surface-variant": "#EEEEEE",
  "primary": "#1867C0",
  "primary-darken-1": "#1F5592",
  "secondary": "#48A9A6",
  "secondary-darken-1": "#018786",
  "error": "#B00020",
  "info": "#2196F3",
  "success": "#4CAF50",
  "warning": "#FB8C00"
}
```

5. **Theme Variants**: Request AI to generate alternative themes, such as dark mode adaptations or seasonal variations.

### 3. Creating Visual Assets

AI-powered design tools simplify the creation of essential brand assets:

- **Logo Design**: Use AI to generate a logo based on your project name and selected image.
- **Icon Design**: Tools like Adobe Express can help you design icons, such as a 512x512 SVG logo for app or web use.
- **Additional Graphics**: Create banners, social media templates, and promotional materials using online platforms or desktop design software.

By integrating personal elements and leveraging AI, you can efficiently build a cohesive and professional brand identity that aligns with your vision.
