# Best practices

## Basics

Designing an effective database structure is crucial for performance, scalability, and maintainability. Here are some common best practices, particularly in the context of Oracle databases, with examples:

1. **Normalization** - to organize data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Example:

Instead of storing customer information repeatedly in an Orders table, create a separate Customers table and reference it using a foreign key.

2. **Use of Primary Keys** - to uniquely identify each record in a table.

Example:

In a Products table, each product could have a unique ID as the primary key.

3. **Use of Foreign Keys for Referential Integrity** - to maintain consistency across related tables.

Example:

The Orders table might have a CustomerID field that is a foreign key referencing the Customers table.

Note that in Oracle database indexes for foreign keys are not created automatically.

4. **Appropriate Data Types** - to use the most suitable data types for each column to optimize storage and performance.

Example:

Use VARCHAR2 for variable-length strings and NUMBER for numerical values in Oracle.

5. **Indexing for Performance** - to improve query performance.

Example:

Creating an index on frequently searched columns, like creating an index on CustomerID in the Orders table.

6. **Avoiding Excessive Normalization (Denormalization)** - to improve performance by reducing the number of joins needed, particularly in read-heavy databases.

Example:

In a reporting database, you might include the customer's name directly in the Orders table to avoid a join with the Customers table.

7. **Using Sequences for Auto-Incrementing Fields** - to generate unique values for primary key fields.

Example:

Creating a sequence for OrderID in the Orders table to ensure each order has a unique identifier.

8. **Implementing Audit Trails** - to keep track of changes for compliance and debugging.

Example:

Having CreatedDate and LastModifiedDate columns in tables to track when records are created and last updated.

9. **Designing for Concurrency** - to allow multiple users to access and modify data concurrently without conflicts.

Example:

Using Oracle's built-in locking mechanisms and designing transactions to be short to reduce locking conflicts.

10. **Consider Partitioning for Large Tables** - to improve performance and manageability for very large tables.

Example:

Partitioning a Sales table by year or region, so queries on a specific year or region are faster.

11. **Consistent Naming Conventions** - to make the schema easier to understand and navigate.

Example:

Prefixing table names with their functional area, like HR_Employees, FIN_Accounts.

12. **Planning for Growth** - to design a scalable database that can handle increased data volume and user load.

Example:

Anticipating future columns and relationships that might be needed and designing tables with flexibility in mind.

**Conclusion**

These best practices can guide you in designing a robust, efficient, and scalable database structure in Oracle. The key is to balance normalization for data integrity, denormalization for performance, and a clear understanding of your application's specific requirements.
