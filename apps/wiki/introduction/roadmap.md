# Roadmap

After validating your vision, the next step is implementation. Before diving into execution, it is essential to create a comprehensive timeline outlining how your objectives will be achievedâ€”this is commonly referred to as a **roadmap**.

A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that outlines the vision and strategic direction of a product or solution over time. It is an actionable plan detailing how a product will evolve to meet its goals. Product owners and stakeholders use roadmap to plan future functionalities, prioritize new features, and communicate key milestones.

### Components of a Product Roadmap

1. **Current State**: Clearly define the current status of the product or organization, including key metrics and benchmarks.
2. **Future Vision**: Specify the long-term goals or features that align with user needs and market trends.
3. **Implementation Plan**: Detail actionable steps, deliverables, and timelines to bridge the gap between the current state and the desired future vision.

### Business vs. Technical Roadmap

While business roadmap focus on product goals, market strategies, and user benefits, technical roadmap emphasize the underlying architecture, infrastructure, and engineering milestones required to support those business objectives.
