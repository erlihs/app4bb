A vision describes the long-term desired outcome for your company and product, outlining what it aims to achieve. It is strategic and overarching, defining the value you aspire to provide to your users. The vision embodies the "why" behind your product, offering a futuristic, long-term perspective of its ultimate objective.

An effective vision statement should be clear, concise, and motivational. It serves as a guiding principle that aligns the efforts of your team and inspires stakeholders to work toward a common goal.
