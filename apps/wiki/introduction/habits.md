## Iterations and frequent feedback loops

Break down the development process into manageable tasks and create a roadmap to guide your progress. Use project management tools or techniques like Agile methodologies to stay organized and track your progress effectively.

Gather feedback after each iteration as frequent feedback loops support continuous improvement, enable timely adjustments, enhance motivation, and ensure customer satisfaction.
