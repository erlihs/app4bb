# Why do we need yet another web application?

> We don't need yet another web application. We need time. Time to do things that are of high value to us. And if any of these things need a web application, this is the right place to start

### With the **Simplicity**, **Scalability**, and **Security** in mind

- "do you really need this" instead of "how you need this"
- only the bare minimum of traffic between user's device and server
- navigation guards on the firs line

### Built on the top of amazing technologies, connecting

- as enterprise as it can get [Oracle Data base](https://www.oracle.com/database/) 
- true open source community driven [Vue Ecosystem](https://vuejs.org/)
